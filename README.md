# Unbound

Note that this is a very much a **work in progress**. <del>A semi-playable build is projected to be completed in early-to-mid April.</del> As of May 2018, this project is no longer being worked on.

This is my attempt to create a simplified, isometric version of Bethesda's popular RPG 
[_The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim), using the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) 
game development platform.

This project will include quite extensive C# scripting, animations, textures and meshes, music, and artwork. Some of these assets I've
borrowed from creators on Unity's [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). Their permissions, of course, belong to their respective
owners.
